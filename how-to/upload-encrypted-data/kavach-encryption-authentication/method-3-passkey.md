**Success Response:**

Code**:** `200 OK`

Content**:**

```json
true
```

Notes**:** A response of `true` indicates successful registration with WebAuthn.

***

**Error Responses for both endpoints:**

Code**:** `400 Bad Request`

Content**:**

```json
{
  "error": "Invalid data or address format."
}
```

Code**:** `401 Unauthorized`

Content**:**

```json
{
  "error": "Invalid or expired signed message."
}
```

Code**:** `500 Internal Server Error`

Content**:**

```json
{
  "error": "Server error, please try again later."
}
```

***

**Notes & Usage:**

* The registration process involves two main steps:
  1. Initiate the registration by sending the user's address to the `start` endpoint. This returns challenge data which is then used in the WebAuthn `navigator.credentials.create()` function.
  2. Complete the registration by sending the generated credential data to the `finish` endpoint.
* Always ensure you handle the challenge data and serialized credential data securely.

***

{% hint style="info" %}
Use the Bearer Authorization token (signed message) for authenticating API requests. Always renew the signed message if it expires or is invalidated.
{% endhint %}

***

By following these steps, users can register securely using WebAuthn with the Lighthouse system. Always ensure the security and integrity of the data exchanged during the registration process.
